# Generic BST
This is an example of a binary search tree that will take any binaryNode of a certain value type and return the depth of any binaryNode

## Requirements
Java and Maven
## Running tests
The command *mvn clean test* runs the tests
## Running the program
The command *mvn clean install* constructs the jar file bst-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.
The command *java -jar bst-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar* runs the application.
It will prompt you to enter the list of numbers as an array of integers.
Then it will print out the list of the deepest nodes with their value and the depth in the tree.
